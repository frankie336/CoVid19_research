# CoVid19_research

In this unprecedented time and challenges to be faced and surmounted by the Human species. Clear, authoritative data looks to be our only advantage thus far. We must all re-deploy skills and expertise for the greater good. Lock down does not have to mean Netlfix and Domino’s Pizza. Do what you are. Using authoritative data to inform costly business decisions means that you are not simply reliant on a very taciturn media in this moment of time.  

Below, I have written a small piece of code that can :

    • Ingest the Live Corona-virus curated by The Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering 
    • Draw live correlation charts 
    • Make the live data further available for local modeling, interpretation  
 
 
Below is the full code , ready to go  and it will be on my GitHub page in due course . If you have any business inquiries, please contact me : francis.neequaye@gmail.com 

Example Graphing attached. In an abundance of accommodation for all skill levels, I have made extract explanatory annotations. 

Share it, improve it, make comment, change the World.  

God Speed .
